    <h2>Pancakes</h2>
    <p>
      Do you crave pancakes that are golden brown on the outside, light and
      fluffy on the inside, with a touch of crispness around the edges? (Who
      doesn't?) Read on to see how to make your pancake dreams a breakfast
      reality in your very own kitchen, then stick around for a breakfast buffet
      of pancake recipes and serving ideas.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Have all ingredients at room temperature.</li>
      <li>Whisk dry ingredients together in one bowl.</li>
      <li>Next, whisk wet ingredients together in another bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour wet ingredients into the
        dry. Stir gently with a spoon or spatula to combine until ingredients
        are just moistened. Don't overmix. Why? The gluten in the flour starts
        to develop as soon as liquid touches it, and the more you mix, the
        tougher the gluten becomes. Tough gluten makes for tough pancakes. If
        your batter has lumps, that's fine; they'll cook out on the griddle.
        Trust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a ladle, measuring cup, or squeeze bottle to portion out the batter.
        Make a small test pancake first to check the heat of your pan; adjust
        the temperature up or down as needed. If your pancake is scorched on the
        outside and raw on the inside, turn down the heat.
